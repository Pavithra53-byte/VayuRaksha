# VayuRaksha: AI-Driven Urban Air Filtration System

## Overview
**VayuRaksha** is an original concept developed by **M. Pavithra (India)**.  
It introduces a **localized, AI-powered, solar-enabled air filtration system** that targets **vehicular pollution in high-traffic hotspots**. The system combines **IoT sensors, GPS, predictive AI models, and modular roadside filters** to dynamically reduce pollutants (NOx, PM2.5, CO, SO₂) and provide real-time insights.  

Unlike existing large-scale air purification towers, which are reactive and have limited coverage, VayuRaksha is **predictive, scalable, and cost-effective**, offering proactive filtration and actionable data for both **citizens** and **urban planners**.  

This project idea has been recognized at a **national level (Top 5 finalist out of 43,971 applicants in India’s Scholar Awards)**.

## Key Features
- **Localized Filtration Units** – Solar-powered roadside devices for on-site pollution interception.  
- **Predictive AI Models** – Anticipates pollution surges using traffic, weather, and historical data.  
- **GPS + Mapping Integration** – Enables area-based coverage and pollution map creation (potential Google Maps tie-up).  
- **Health-Centric Routing** – Pollution maps can guide vulnerable individuals (e.g., with respiratory issues) to safer routes.  
- **Urban Planning Insights** – Data supports targeted infrastructure and policy decisions.  
- **Sustainability** – Solar-powered, modular, low-cost deployment across cities.

## Expected Outcomes
- Up to **60% reduction** in localized NOx and PM2.5 exposure.  
- **75% lower energy costs** compared to conventional systems.  
- **Extended filter life** with smart activation.  
- **Real-time pollution maps** for public use and government planning.  
- **Scalable deployment** across metro cities and traffic choke points.
